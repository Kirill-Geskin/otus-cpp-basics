# Task 2

Setting up a local environment for further work It's time to prepare a local stand for working on the course. Independent work requires:

1. Customize any IDE you like
2. Achieve the assembly of the sources attached to the materials (`source.zip`)
3. Move the implementation of the `todo_move_me_out` function from the `hello_world.cpp` file into a separate pair of sources: 
	a. `move_me_out.h` - Header file with function declaration 
	b. `move_me_out.cpp` - source file with the implementation of the function
4. main function code should not change
5. Add the appropriate `#include` to the `hello_world.cpp` file
6. You need to add both created files to `CMakeLists.txt`
7. Use CMake to build
8. Upload the result on github.com to your account
